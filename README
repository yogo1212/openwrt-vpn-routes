Typically, VPN clients create routes to their peers to prevent loss of
connection when e.g. a new default route is installed through the VPN.

Not only is the pattern used a lot but there are also some pitfalls:

- multiple destination addresses for a single hostname
- lack of handling for when an interface goes down and traffic is
routed differently
- openwrt's concept for IPv6 multihome routing makes querying routes a bit weird - afaics

Maybe there's a way to get this kind of thing working in netifd?

Example:

# before connecting, fetch the route information to the host:

vpn-route-fetch vpn.gateway.org > /var/run/routes_$config
# or
vpn-route-fetch vpn.gateway.org br-lan > /var/run/routes_$config

# then, apply the routes:
vpn-route-apply add < /var/run/routes_$config

# afterwards, likely in proto_*_teardown:
vpn-route-apply del < /var/run/routes_$config
